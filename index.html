                <p class="secret-story">Compared to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon" target="_blank">Earth's moon</a>, Pluto has only one sixth its mass and one third its volume. Pluto was discovered in 1930, the first object in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_belt" target="_blank">Kuiper belt</a>. It was immediately hailed as the ninth planet, but its planetary status was questioned when it was found to be much smaller than expected. These doubts increased following the discovery of additional objects in the Kuiper belt starting in the 1990s, and particularly the more massive scattered disk object Eris in 2005. In 2006 the International Astronomical Union (IAU) formally redefined the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet" target="_blank">planet</a> to exclude dwarf planets such as Pluto. Many planetary astronomers, however, continue to consider Pluto and other dwarf planets to be planets.</p>

                <p class="secret-story">Pluto is a cartoon character created by The Walt Disney Company. He is a yellow-orange color, medium-sized, short-haired dog with black ears. Unlike most Disney characters, Pluto is not anthropomorphic beyond some characteristics such as facial expression. Together with Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Daisy Duck, and Goofy, Pluto is one of the <a href="https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sensational_Six" target="_blank">"Sensational Six</a>"â€”the biggest stars in the Disney universe. Though all six are non-human animals, Pluto alone is not dressed as a human. Unlike Mickey's other animal friends, such as Goofy (who is also a dog), Pluto is a relatively normal animal, with few anthropomorphic traits apart from his facial expressions. Pluto usually does not speak in English, walk upright, or wear clothing. A significant departure from this was his speaking role in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAEmTWThe4I" target="_blank">The Moose Hunt (1931)</a>, which was produced before Pluto's characterization had been clearly defined. As Pluto made more appearances, it became common that he would mostly speak in barks and grunts like most dogs. Other ways of communicating Pluto's thoughts occur through his facial expressions, and sometimes through the use of a shoulder <a href="https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5fnbvf" target="_blank">angel/devil who speak directly to Pluto</a>.</p>

                <h3 class="secret-title">Is Pluto even not originally Pluto?</h3>
                <p class="secret-story">The name Pluto was proposed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetia_Burney" target="_blank">Venetia Burney</a>, an eleven-year-old schoolgirl in Oxford, England, who was interested in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mythology" target="_blank">classical mythology</a>. She suggested it in a conversation with her grandfather Falconer Madan, a former librarian at the University of Oxford's Bodleian Library, who passed the name to astronomy professor Herbert Hall Turner, who cabled it to colleagues in the United States. The name 'Pluto' was soon embraced by wider culture. In 1930, Walt Disney was apparently inspired by it when he introduced for Mickey Mouse a canine companion named Pluto, although Disney animator Ben Sharpsteen could not confirm why the name was given. The Etruscan god Aita and the Roman gods Dis Pater and Orcus were eventually taken as equivalent to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hades" target="_blank">Hades</a> and merged into Pluto, a Latinisation of Plouton, itself a euphemistic title often given to Hades, the god of the dead and the king of the underworld, with which his name became synonymous.</p>
